## **Project History**
The idea for the stemmed from a difficulty in finding thrift stores and a lack of spaces dedicated to relevant thrifting information. Moreover, not every thrift/vintage location appears on online maps, adding to some of the inaccesibility faced 
by vintage and thrift lovers alike. 

Therefore, the web application HighVintage aims to provide an online space that nurtures a sound thrifting community where people can share their thrifted items and styles, recommend stores, and freely discuss anything related to thrifting.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a community where users can help each other have the best thrifting experience possible. As the community grows, we hope for thrifting to be recognized as a more accessible way of shopping so more people can make environmentally-friendly choices while elevating their wardrobes. The HighVintage community can help this happen.
